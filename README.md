## Project Purpose
This React application allows users to view app details and install apps directly from the interface.  
The “Install Now” button stores installed apps in `localStorage` and prevents duplicate installations.  
The application also features:

- Conditional disabling of the install button based on installation status.  
- Persistent state using `localStorage` across page refreshes.  
- Toast notifications for successful installations or duplicates.  
- Detailed app information including image, title, company, size, rating, downloads, and reviews.

- **localStorage** – To persist installed apps across sessions  
- **React Toastify** – For toast notifications  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic and data handling
